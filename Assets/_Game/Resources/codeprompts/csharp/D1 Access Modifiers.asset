    public: The type or
    member is accessible from any other code in the same assembly or another assembly
    that references it.

    private: The type or member is only accessible within
    the containing type.

    protected: The type or member is accessible within
    the containing type and derived types.

    internal: The type or member is accessible
    within the same assembly but not from another assembly.

    protected internal:
    The type or member is accessible within the same assembly and from derived types
    in any assembly.'
